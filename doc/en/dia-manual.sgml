  <para>
   <application>Dia</application> is an application for creating technical 
   diagrams. Its interface and features are loosely patterned after 
   the Windows program Visio. Features of Dia include multiple-page printing, 
   export to many formats (EPS, SVG, CGM and PNG), and the ability 
   to use custom shapes created by the user as simple XML descriptions. 
   <application>Dia</application> is useful for drawing UML diagrams, network 
   maps, and flowcharts.

         User-defined objects allow a user to create their own objects, 
         which are based off of a prefabricated template.
        </para>
        <para>
         For example, clicking on the square object and placing it on the
         canvas, creates a square.  However, the dimensions of the object can
         be changed.  See the Resizing Objects section for more information.

  <title>Selection Introduction</title>
   <para>
       Selecting objects is probably the most frequently task that is used
       to be done when using <application>Dia</application>. From the moment
       you create a new object to the moment you think the diagram looks the
       way it should be, you will always have to select objects to set them
       up properly.  
       <!-- I must confess that this intro really sucks -->
   </para>
   <para>
       Selecting objects can be done in many different ways, and there are
       also many operations that can be perform on these selected objects.
   </para>
   <para>
       You can select objects to simply drag them around the diagram, or to
       group them in a logical way to manipulate them more easily, to connect
       them each others, or to simply remove them from the diagram.
   </para>
   <note>
     <!-- this note is for those that already know how to select objects but can't
            do it. It's a quick link related to the Layer's problems.  -->
     <para>
        Only objects present in the current layer can be selected. If an object
        doesn't want to be select it's probably because it is situated in another
        layer. To know how to change the current layer or how to manipulate many
        layers, please refer to the Managing Layers section.

  <title>How To Select Objects</title>

    <title>Basic Selection</title>
     <para>
         The basic way to select an object is by clicking on it.
     </para>
     <para>
         When the object is selected it appears on the diagram with some little
         green points on its corners and on its sides.
     </para>
     <para>
         Once the green points appeared, you can start manipulate this object as you
         wish. When you're done with it you can deselect this object by clicking on 
         any free space of the diagram, the green points will desappear and selection
         of an other object becomes possible.
     </para>   
    </sect3>
    
    <sect3 id="multi-selection">
    <title>Multiple Selection</title>
     <para>
         The simplest way to select more than one object at the time, is by clicking 
         on a free space of the diagram with the left mouse button and moving the mouse 
         while pressing on it. Doing so will draw a thin rectangle on the Canvas. All 
         objects present in this area will be selected when depressing the button.
     </para>
     <para>
         An other way to do so is by holding down the Shift key while selecting the 
         objects by clicking them one by one.         
     </para>
     <para>
         Once your selection is complete, each of the selected objects must appear
         with its own green points as described above.
     </para>
     <para>
         Multiple selection is useful when you want apply the same operation on many
         different objects and you don't want waste time by selecting them one by one.
     </para>   
     <para>
         When selected, objects act like a group. Meaning that if you try to drag one
         of them, it is the whole group that will move. The same if you try to delete 
         one of them, it is the whole group that will be removed from the diagram.
     </para>
     <para>
         Then if you click on any free space on the diagram or if you change to another 
         layer, you will loose the selection. Or if you want to add some more objects
         to your selection, simply hold down the Shift key again and click on the items 
         that you want add.
     </para>
     <note>
      <para>
         Assuming that you selected some objects on your diagram, it is still possible
         to resize one of them without changing the size or position of other selected
         objects. To learn how to resize objects see the Resizing Objects section.

     Dear reader,
       I (Kevin Breit) appologize for this documentaiton being incomplete.
     <application>Dia</application> itself is a large application with a lot
     to document.  There are probably places with spelling errors, places that
     say TODO and a ton of features which just aren't covered period.  I am
     sorry about this inconvenience.  Rest assured that the <application>Dia
     </application> documentation developers are working hard to get this
     completed for the average user to comprehend.  Again, I am sorry that this
     is incomplete.  Check back in future versions to see advancements in this
     manual.

     Sincerly,
