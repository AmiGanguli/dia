  <title>Introduction</title>
  <para>
   <application>Dia</application> is an application for creating technical diagrams. Its interface and features are loosely patterned after 
the Windows program Visio. Features of Dia include multiple-page printing, export to many formats (EPS, SVG, CGM and PNG), and the ability 
to use custom shaped created by the user as simple XML descriptions. Dia is useful for drawing UML diagrams, network maps, and flowcharts.

  <title>Making a Diagram</title>
   <para>
    A diagram is made up of objects.  Objects are shapes that can be different
    colors, shapes, and sizes.  They include everything from 2-bit images to
    full color pictures to text.
   </para>
   <para>
    To an object to the canvas, click on an object in the toolbar and click
    on the canvas.  The selected object will appear.  The object can be

   <para>
    In the toolbar, you can double-click on any object to view its advanced
    properties.  This allows you to customize the stock shape more to your

    Layers are a way of creating multiple-images so that they are one image.
    By doing this, a user can edit one layer without worrying about affecting
    any of the other layers.

   <para>
    Transparency is hard at work in Dia.  Transparency allows objects to have
    transparent parts of an object, so that anything behind the transparent
    section shows through.

    Plug-ins allow the average user to easily add new object types to Dia, to
    help extend its functionability.

  <title>Canvas Introduction</title>
   <para>
    The canvas is the main part of Dia.  The Dia canvas is the window where all
    the user's objects will be placed on the screen and arranged.  When the
    diagram is printed or saved, the contents of the canvas will be saved.
   </para>

  <sect2 id="gridlines">
  <title>Gridlines</title>
   <para>
    Gridlines are similar to the lines on graph paper.  They allow the user

    going into File->Preferences->Grid Lines and clicking on the Visible button
    to make it say No.

    The background color option allows you to change what the background looks

    can be changed by going into View->Diagram Properties->Background and
    clicking on the bar.  The bar displays what your background color is.
    The gridlines will change their color automatically to stay visible if
    the background color is changed to black.

   <title>Adding Objects</title>
    <para>
     Adding objects to the <application>Dia</application> canvas can be
     accomplished by clicking on the desired object in the toolbox to select
     what you want placed on the canvas.  Clicking on the canvas will then
     place the object on the canvas.
    </para>
    <para>
     <application>Dia</application> provides two types of objects:
      <itemizedlist>
       <listitem>
        <para>
         User-defined objects allow a user to create their own objects, 
         which are based off of a prefabricated template.
        </para>
        <para>
         For example, clicking on the square object and placing it on the
         canvas, creates a square.  However, the dimensions of the object can
         be changed.  See the Resizing Objects section for more information.
         <!-- Add link to resizing objects -->
        </para>
       </listitem>
       <listitem>
        <para>
         Pre-defined objects are mostly designs which cannot be edited.
         They can be resized, but the object itself cannot be edited.

   <sect3 id="moving-objects">
   <title>Moving Objects</title>
    <para>
     When an object is inserted into the canvas, the desired object will appear
     with small green boxes defining the borders.  <!-- Insert Graphic -->
     The area inside the boxes is the object area.  Click and hold on the
     object area.  Then move the mouse around, inside the canvas, to move
     the object to another place on the canvas.
    </para>
   </sect3>
   <sect3 id="resizing-objects">
   <title>Resizing Objects</title>
    <para>
     In the previous paragraph, is explained the concept of the green boxes.
     These are used to manipulate the size of the object.  To change the size,
     click and hold on a green button.  Drag to the respective size, then let
     go.
    </para>
    <para>
     The corner green buttons will change both height and width.  The four in
     the middle will edit the respective property.  So, the boxes on the side
     will edit the width while the two on the top edit the height.
    </para>
    <tip>
     <para>
      To drag with the corner buttons, but keep perportions, hold the shift key
      while resizing.  This only applies to the special objects, not regular
      shapes.
