   <title>Adding Objects</title>
    <para>
     Adding objects to the <application>Dia</application> canvas can be
     accomplished by clicking on the desired object in the 
     <interface>Toolbox</interface> to select what you want placed on the 
     canvas.  
     Clicking on the canvas will then place the object on the canvas.
    </para>
    <para>
     <application>Dia</application> provides two types of objects:
      <itemizedlist>
       <listitem>
        <para>
         User-defined objects allow a user to create their own objects,
         which are based off of a prefabricated template.
        </para>
        <para>
         For example, clicking on the square object and placing it on the
         canvas, creates a square.  However, the dimensions of the object can
         be changed.  See the Resizing Objects section for more information.
         <!-- Add link to resizing objects -->
        </para>
       </listitem>
       <listitem>
        <para>
         Pre-defined objects are mostly designs which cannot be edited.
         They can be resized, but the object itself cannot be edited.

   <title>Moving Objects</title>
    <para>
     When an object is inserted into the canvas, the desired object will appear
     with small green boxes (also known as handles) defining the borders.

     </figure> 
     The area inside the boxes is the object area.  Click and hold on the
     object area.  Then move the mouse around, inside the canvas, to move
     the object to another place on the canvas.

   <title>Resizing Objects</title>
    <para>
     The previous paragraph, explains the concept of the green boxes.
     These are used to manipulate the size of the object.  To change the size,
     click and hold on a green button.  Drag to the respective size, then let
     go.
    </para>
    <para> 
     The corner green buttons will change both the height and the width at 
     the same time.       
     The two on the top and bottom edges, in the center will edit height while
     the two on the left and right edges, in the center will edit width.  
     Some shapes 
    </para>
    <tip>
     <para>
      To drag with the corner buttons, but keep proportions, hold the shift key
      while resizing.  This only applies to the special objects, not regular
      shapes.

   <title>Deleting Objects</title>

   <title>Grouping Objects</title>
    <para>
       Grouping allows you to treat several objects as a unified group that 
       acts a lot more like a single object.  A group enables you to 
       fix the position of the objects in releation to each other.  
       Select more than one object and then from the menu choose 
       Object, Group to group them.

     One of <application>Dia</application>'s objects is the line.  The line
     object is symbolized by the following icon:
