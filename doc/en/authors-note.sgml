     Dear reader,
       I (Kevin Breit) appologize for this documentaiton being incomplete.
     <application>Dia</application> itself is a large application with a lot
     to document.  There are probably places with spelling errors, places that
     say TODO and a ton of features which just aren't covered period.  I am
     sorry about this inconvenience.  Rest assured that the <application>Dia
     </application> documentation developers are working hard to get this
     completed for the average user to comprehend.  Again, I am sorry that this
     is incomplete.  Check back in future versions to see advancements in this
     manual.
