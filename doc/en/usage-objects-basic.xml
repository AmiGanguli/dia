<title>Basic Objects Introduction</title>
  <para>
   The first, and most common type of object is the basic object.  Basic objects normally are geometric shapes, which can be customized.  <application>Dia</application> offers
the user numerous basic objects.
  </para>
  <sect2 id="text">
  <title>Text</title>
   <para>
    <application>Dia</application> supports the use of text as its own type of
    object.  Text can be placed on the canvas by clicking on the text button on
    the toolbox.
   </para>
   <para>
The text object, and several other objects, offers direct text entry in the
dia gram.  Text can be entered by selecting the object and then typing the text. The font,
size, and other formatting properties can be changed by double-clicking the
object.
</para>
<para>
Here are some important tips regarding short-cut keys when entering text.
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
The normal Copy / Cut / Paste keys (CTRL-C, CTRL-X, CTRL-V) don't work for
text. They work for entire objects. Use CTRL-SHIFT-X to cut and 
CTRL-SHIFT-V to paste just the text in an object. There is no shortcut to copy
just the text. 
</para>
<note><para>When you paste text into an object, the text is
formatted according to the Dia object properties, not the text source.
</para></note>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
You cannot select a section of text inside an object with the mouse (this
moves the object). You can insert characters at the current cursor position
just by typing. You can delete the character to the left of the mouse using
Backspace. 
</para>
<note><para>
The DEL key deletes the entire object, not the text
to the right of the cursor. Use SHIFT-DEL to delete the text to the right of
the cursor. (Use Edit / Undo or CTRL-Z if you delete an object by mistake.) To
delete all of the text in an object, use the Cut (CTRL-SHIFT-X). 
</para></note>
</listitem>

 If you are using a non-default font or font size, one trick for productivity
is to create a palette of empty objects with the desired font settings on a
separate diagram. Then copy and paste these objects onto your working diagram
as you need them (i.e., instead of using the toolbar).
</para></listitem>

     Text in <application>Dia</application> can use any font available to Gnome.
