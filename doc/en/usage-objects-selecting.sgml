  <title>Selection Introduction</title>
   <para>
       Selecting objects is probably the most frequently task that is used
       to be done when using <application>Dia</application>. From the moment
       you create a new object to the moment you think the diagram looks the
       way it should be, you will always have to select objects to set them
       up properly.
       <!-- I must confess that this intro really sucks -->
   </para>
   <para>
       Selecting objects can be done in many different ways, and there are
       also many operations that can be perform on these selected objects.
   </para>
   <para>
       You can select objects to simply drag them around the diagram, or to
       group them in a logical way to manipulate them more easily, to connect
       them each others, or to simply remove them from the diagram.
   </para>
   <note>
     <!-- this note is for those that already know how to select objects but can't
            do it. It's a quick link related to the Layer's problems.  -->
     <para>
        Only objects present in the current layer can be selected. If an object
        doesn't want to be select it's probably because it is situated in another
        layer. To know how to change the current layer or how to manipulate many
        layers, please refer to the Managing Layers section.

    <title>Basic Selection</title>
     <para>
         The basic way to select an object is by clicking on it.
     </para>
     <para>
         When the object is selected it appears on the diagram with some little
         green points on its corners and on its sides.
     </para>
     <para>
         Once the green points appeared, you can start manipulate this object as you
         wish. When you're done with it you can deselect this object by clicking on
         any free space of the diagram, the green points will desappear and selection
         of an other object becomes possible.
     </para>
    </sect3>
 
    <sect3 id="multi-selection">
    <title>Multiple Selection</title>
     <para>
         The simplest way to select more than one object at the time, is by clicking
         on a free space of the diagram with the left mouse button and moving the mouse
         while pressing on it. Doing so will draw a thin rectangle on the Canvas. All
         objects present in this area will be selected when depressing the button.
     </para>
     <para>
         An other way to do so is by holding down the Shift key while selecting the
         objects by clicking them one by one.
     </para>
     <para>
         Once your selection is complete, each of the selected objects must appear
         with its own green points as described above.
     </para>
     <para>
         Multiple selection is useful when you want apply the same operation on many
         different objects and you don't want waste time by selecting them one by one.
     </para>
     <para>
         When selected, objects act like a group. Meaning that if you try to drag one
         of them, it is the whole group that will move. The same if you try to delete
         one of them, it is the whole group that will be removed from the diagram.
     </para>
     <para>
         Then if you click on any free space on the diagram or if you change to another
         layer, you will loose the selection. Or if you want to add some more objects
         to your selection, simply hold down the Shift key again and click on the items
         that you want add.
     </para>
     <note>
      <para>
         Assuming that you selected some objects on your diagram, it is still possible
         to resize one of them without changing the size or position of other selected
         objects. To learn how to resize objects see the Resizing Objects section.

    <title>Other Ways for Selecting Objects</title>
    <para>
       Other ways for selecting objects are describe below, all these options can be
       reached in the <interface>Main Popup Menu</interface> under the
       <menuchoice><guimenu>Select</guimenu></menuchoice> menu :

          <para>
            Choosing the <menuchoice><guimenuitem>All</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
            option will let you select all the objects present on the current layer,
            the same way as you could do it by hand.
          </para>
          <para>
            This option is a shortcut of when your diagram contains a lot of objects
            and you don't want waste your time in selecting objects one by one.

             Selecting the <menuchoice><guimenuitem>None</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
             option will deselect objects you have selected before. It has the
             same effect as when you clicking on any free part of your diagram.
          </para>
          <para>                                                                                     After you have deselected objects you cannot perform any operation on
             them anymore. So you have to select them again to continue
          </para>
          <tip>
            <para>
              Often you will have to keep your selections persistent, to do so, you
              can form an arbitrary group with the selected items or cut and paste
              them in a new layer that will contain all the objects of your selection.

              Admiting you have ten items on your diagram and want to select only eight

              the <menuchoice><guimenu>Select</guimenu></menuchoice> menu.

           <para>
              Simply select by hand the two objects you don't need, then check the
              <menuchoice><guimenuitem>Invert</guimenuitem></menuchoice> option and you
              will get the eight objects you wanted being selected and the two others

       One really useful and powerful feature of <application>Dia</application> is its
       ability of handling connection between objects.
     </para>
     <para>
       Connections, in <application>Dia</application>, can be used for many purposes. The
       first, and not the least, is to explicitly specify a direct relationship
       between two objects.
     </para>
     <para>
       The second could be it is easier to manage objects that behave efficiently in
       following established rules and that can be acceded in a few clicks.

        should read the Connecting Objects section.
      </para>

     <para>
       Selecting objects connected to a particular object, is as simple than selecting
       this particular object, right click on the Canvas to get the
       <interface>Main Popup Menu</interface> appear and click on the
       <menuchoice>
          <guimenu>Select</guimenu>
          <guimenuitem>Connected</guimenuitem>
       </menuchoice> button.
     </para>
     <para>
       If this object doesn't have any object connected to it, that will do nothing.
       Otherwise, all the connected objects will be magicaly selected and will form
       a new group of temporary selected objects.
     </para>
     <note>
      <para>
        If you repeat this manipulation again, that will be all the connected objects
        to this new group that will be add to the selection.
      </para>
      <para>
        You can redo the operation until you have selected all objects that were
        connected all together.

    <title>Selecting  Transitive Objects</title>
     <para>
      Technic shown above is pretty fine when you only want select a small number of
      connected objects at the time.
     </para>
     <para>
       Sometimes you will have to select a whole bunch of objects that are connected
       all together and that way of selecting objects step by step won't be really
       efficient if it happens to often.
     </para>
     <para>
       This is the reason why <application>Dia</application> offers you to do all these
       steps at once.
     </para>
     <para>
        To do so, select the root object you desire, then right click on the
        Canvas to have the
       <interface>Main Popup Menu</interface> appear on screen, but this time choose the 
       <menuchoice>
          <guimenu>Select</guimenu>
          <guimenuitem>Transitive</guimenuitem>
       </menuchoice> button instead of <guimenuitem>Connected</guimenuitem>.
     </para>
     <para>
       And that's it, all objects that were connected to the root object you
       choose are now selected and ready to be manipulate and waiting for you to
       apply on them any number of operation that you would like.

    <title>Selecting Same Type of Objects</title>                                            <para>
        <application>Dia</application> implements as well some trick to select objects
        that issued from the same type.
     </para>
     <para>
        Meaning that if, for any reason, you need to select objects matching the same
        type (all Rectangles, Lines or any custom Shape) you could do it by selecting
        an object of the type you need to select and click, in the
        <interface>Main Popup Menu</interface>, the
        <menuchoice>
          <guimenu>Select</guimenu>
          <guimenuitem>Same Type</guimenuitem>
       </menuchoice> button.
     </para>
     <para>
       This will automaticaly select all objects that correspond to the type you have
       chosen. Only objects present in the current layer will be selected.
