   <para>
    The canvas is the main part of Dia.  The Dia canvas is the window where all
    the user's objects will be placed on the screen and arranged.  When the
    diagram is printed or saved, the contents of the canvas will be saved.

  <title>Gridlines</title>
   <para>
    Gridlines are similar to the lines on graph paper.  They allow the user
    to easily align objects on the canvas.  The gridlines can be hidden by
    going into File->Preferences->Grid Lines and clicking on the Visible button
    to make it say No.

  <title>Rulers</title>
   <para>
    Rulers appear on the top and the left of the <application>Dia</application>
    canvas.  They show, in centimeters, how large your canvas is.
    <!-- Discuss the arrows which show where the cursor is -->

  <title>Background Color</title>
   <para>
    The background color option allows you to change what the background looks
    like in the canvas.  By default, the color is white.  However, the color
    can be changed by going into
    <menuchoice>
      <guimenu>
        View
      </guimenu>
      <guimenu>
        Diagram Properties
      </guimenu>
      <guimenuitem>
        Background
      </guimenuitem>
    </menuchoice>
    and
    clicking on the bar.  The bar displays what your background color is.
    The gridlines will change their color automatically to stay visible if
    the background color is changed to black.
   </para>
