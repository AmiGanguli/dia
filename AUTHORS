This is only a placeholder file; the real content of AUTHORS is 
generated from the output of dia --credits, when 'make dist' is 
run to create a distributable dia tarball. The authors of dia 
can also be seen from the about box in any up-to-date copy of 
dia. 

This slightly messy procedure is due to the fact that the 
definitive list of authors in dia is hard-coded into dia, yet 
automake(1) requires AUTHORS to be present at 'make dist' stage 
because the GNU coding standards require it. 

(if you with to review the list of authors before building dia, you 
can have a look at the contents of the file 
$(top_srcdir)/app/authors.h)
