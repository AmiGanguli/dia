TODO:
=====
general:
* change cursors more, ie. when the mouse is grabbed for resizing/moving stuff.
* download insure++ and try it on dia. Maybe try purify too.
* check the write_* functions on different architectures.
* command line options (load files)
* Tab order in properties dialogs. (How do you specify this in gtk?)
* If you hold down shift while moving the handle of an 'Element',
  scale while keeping same proportions.

gtk:
 keyboard accelerators can be better:
*  They don't work at all on 1.1.x
*  On 1.0.x you have to open the pop-up menu once in a window befor you
    can use them

functions:
 undo
 
renderer:
 images

objects:
 text_object: Add font to properties dialog.
 render_object: better distance_from that can be specified by the object programmer.
 Bitmapped image object
 Vector image object (for maps and stuff). CGM?
 properties dialogs in all object-types, see textobj

UML:
 Class: * class can be object => underlined name
          (Is this really in UML? Can't find it in specs?)
 Aggregate: * Has some problems laying out the text at the ends.
 All:   * Change some entries to comboboxes with pre-selectable texts.
          (Mostly stereotypes)

Big stuff:
 * load/save in xml-format. Needs much support so objects can easily save their variables and so the format is easy for other programs to generate.
 * some kind of 'plug-in api' so that libraries like uml can add new
   functions to the menus (like: load UMX)

---------------------------------------------------------------

BUGS:
=====
* pressing '+' and '-' when a focus is activated it gets both to the focus and zooms.

* doesn't use latin-1 or some other well-known 8-bit encoding in eps_renderer

* If you move an object outside the visible screen, scroll there move the object back
  and then scroll back, the (now) unused area is not removed.

* If you double-click on the color-selector as the first thing you do
  sometimes the program crashes.

* eps imported into lyx is shown ok, but the bounding-box is wrong...

* Sometimes the scrollbars turn weird when you remove the last
  object. (Try: move around the last object a bit and then press ctrl-x.)

---------------------------------------------------------------

Interesting Stuff from the real Visio:
======================================
Move connection points
Fill patterns
line patterns
shadow color
object corner types
Editing of groups in a separate window
Perspecitve point
Lockable handles
Rotate stuff, to complex to be implemented in this version.
