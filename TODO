TODO:
=====
general:
* change cursors more, ie. when the mouse is grabbed for resizing/moving stuff.
* download insure++ and try it on dia. Maybe try purify too.
* check the write_* functions on different architectures.
* command line options (load files)
* Tab order in properties dialogs. (How do you specify this in gtk?)
* If you hold down shift while moving the handle of an 'Element',
  scale while keeping same proportions.
* Must be able to change background color.
* Maybe be able to set a default linestyle, much like the current linewidth
  widget.
* save more stuff in the diagram file. grid, bg etc.
* is there a better way to calculate font-properties. Rendering 100 pixel hig fonts
  is very slow.
* Update to automake 1.4 and libtool 1.3 when they're released. It has
  much better support for dlopen:ed modules.

gtk:
 Keyboard accelerator '+' and '-' doesn't work.

functions:
* undo, see event model later in this file.
 
renderer:
* images
* add begin/end rendering methods.

objects:
* finish the network objects
* add new object-lib: Entity-Relationship modeling.
* render_object: better distance_from that can be specified by the object programmer.
* Bitmapped image object
* Vector image object (for maps and stuff). CGM?

UML:
 Class: * class can be object => underlined name
          (Is this really in UML? Can't find it in specs?)
 Aggregate: * Has some problems laying out the text at the ends.
 All:   * Change some entries to comboboxes with pre-selectable texts.
          (Mostly stereotypes)

Big stuff:
 * some kind of 'plug-in api' so that libraries like uml can add new
   functions to the menus (like: load UMX). This means some parts of
   the Diagram struct has to move to lib/blahblah.h so that object-libraries
   can handle/create whole diagrams (for ie. exporting/importing).
 * Add a clean event model so that all modifications of the diagram and objects
   goes by a well known path. This makes it possible to have a history of
   modifications which means UNDO is easy!
 * Fix up the layer dialog. Also add layer-effects?

---------------------------------------------------------------

BUGS:
=====
* Applying the properties does not recalculate extents.

* UML - Association with direction==Right doesn't always show arrow.
  Problem with bounding box.

* selecting with rubberband and draggin mouse to other window with same diagram
  gives ugly box left on screen.

* Toggling rulers changes the size of the window to the default size.

* pressing '+' and '-' when a focus is activated it gets both to the focus and zooms.

* doesn't use latin-1 or some other well-known 8-bit encoding in eps_renderer

* If you move an object outside the visible screen, scroll there move the object back
  and then scroll back, the (now) unused area is not removed.

* Deleting/Cutting a newly created empty text-object gives a seg-fault.

* If you double-click on the color-selector as the first thing you do
  sometimes the program crashes.

* eps imported into lyx is shown ok, but the bounding-box is wrong...

* Sometimes the scrollbars turn weird when you remove the last
  object. (Try: move around the last object a bit and then press ctrl-x.)

Interesting Stuff from the real Visio:
======================================
Move connection points
Fill patterns
line patterns
shadow color
object corner types
Editing of groups in a separate window
Perspecitve point
Lockable handles
Rotate stuff, to complex to be implemented in this version.
