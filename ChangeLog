	* app/magnify.c:
	* app/modify_tool.c:
	* app/render_gdk.[ch]:
	* lib/render.h:
	Huge cleanup of internal rendering system.
	Moved a lot of data (pixmap, width, height & gc) into the GdkRenderer.
	This gives a few new methods for Interactive Renderers for setting
	clipping regions and drawing pixel based lines and rects.
	Updated the rest of the code to use the new stuff.
	
	* app/render_eps.c:
	Fixed warning.

	* lib/widgets.c:
	* objects/standard/zigzagline.c
	Fixed unused variable warnings.

	* lib/font.c:
	Fixedbug with stringwidth where width==0.

	* TODO:
	Added known bug.

1998-11-02  Alexander Larsson  <alla@lysator.liu.se>

	* lib/widgets.[ch]:
	Added suppot for setting the font of a
	DiaFontSelector widget.
	Also fixed some typos in the header.

	* lib/object.h: 
	Added a comment about the GetPRoperties method call.
	You have to make sure to update widget state when
	this method is called. (Not all objects do this yet,
	to be fixed.)

	* TODO:
	Some small updates

1998-11-01  Alexander Larsson  <alla@lysator.liu.se>

	* lib/font.c
	Fixed problem with height of ascent and descent for fonts.
	It didn't use the whole height (==ascent+descent) when calculatine
	ascent_ratio and descent_ratio.

	* objects/standard/textobj.c:
	* objects/standard/box.c:
	* objects/standard/ellipse.c:
	* objects/standard/line.c:
	* objects/standard/arc.c:
	Updated and added property dialogs for these objects.
	Also added line width/color/style to those objects
	that didn't have it.
	This change breaks fileformat compatibility for these objects.
	
	* objects/standard/zigzagline.c:
	Changed zigzagline to be based on OrthConn, much nicer.
	Also added line style and color to properties.
	This change breaks fileformat compatibility for zigzagline.

	* lib/message.c:
	Fixed bug in message(). Forgot a pair of '&'.

1998-10-29  Alexander Larsson  <alla@lysator.liu.se>

	* lib/widgets.[ch]:
	Added DiaColorSelector widget.
	This is a colored button that pops up a color selection
	dialog when pressed.

1998-10-28  Alexander Larsson  <alla@lysator.liu.se>

	* lib/widgets.[ch]:
	* lib/Makefile.am:

	* lib/Makefile.am:
	* objects/UML/Makefile.am:
	* objects/network/Makefile.am:
	* objects/standard/Makefile.am:
	Changed "CFLAGS = -Wall -g" to "CFLAGS = @CFLAGS@"
	in all Makefile.am.

1998-10-03  Alexander Larsson  <alla@lysator.liu.se>

	* app/handle_ops.c (handle_draw):
	connected HANDLE_MINOR_CONTROL also becomes red.

1998-10-02  Alexander Larsson  <alla@lysator.liu.se>

	* Makefile.am:
	removed -ldl from linking. This is added if needed by configure.

	* app/app_procs.c:
	Open dlls with RTLD_LAZY if it is defined.
	Some cleanups: char *error -> const char *error
	Added fprintf()'s to where we exited because of errors.

	* lib/files.c:
	Include <sys/types.h>

1998-10-01  Alexander Larsson  <alla@lysator.liu.se>

	* acconfig.h:
	* configure.in:
	* app/app_procs.c:
	Detect dlopen better.
	Detect wether dlopen needs an underscore in the identifier.
	This code was mostly borrowed from guile.

	* app/app_procs.c:
	* objects/standard/standard.c:
	* objects/network/network.c:
	* objects/UML/uml.c:
	* most objects:
	Changed the way sheets reference objects to use just the
	name. Changed module loading to a two stage model:
	First register_objects() is called for all modules.
	Then register_sheets() is called. This means that
	sheets can safely include objects from other modules.
	

1998-09-30  Alexander Larsson  <alla@lysator.liu.se>

	* objects/network/bus.c:
	* objects/network/network.c:
	* objects/network/Makefile.am:

	* lib/handle.h:
	* lib/object.c:
	* lib/orth_conn.c:
	* loads of objects:
	Changed handle->connectable to handle->connect_type.
	Now handles can be HANDLE_CONNECTABLE_NOBREAK, which means
	that their connections don't break when moving objects.

	* app/diagram.c:
	Always select the last handle in an object that has
	the closest distance.
	
	* lib/geometry.[ch]:
	Added rectangle_add_point function.

	dialog.

	* app/modify_tool.c: Changed to use new properties dialog.

	* app/object_ops.[ch]: Removed object_changed_callback, as it's
	not needed anymore. This is now handled differently in
	properties.c

	* lib/object.[ch]:
	Changed the properties ops for objects. Removed typedefs
	ChangedObjectTime and ObjectChangedFunc needed for the old way.
	Added object_return_null function.

	* */Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Changes to work with srcdir !=
	builddir.

	* autogen.sh: New file. Copied from gtk and added a call to

1998-09-12  Alexander Larsson  <alla@lysator.liu.se>

	* Added call setlocale(LC_NUMERIC, "C") so that formating of

	* Did some cleanup of generated postscript files.
