1999-02-09  Alejandro Aguilar Sierra  <asierra@servidor.unam.mx>

	* objects/UML/object.c (objet_draw): 
	Completed underlining of all object name lines. 

	* objects/UML/message.c (fill_in_dialog): 
	Fixed a bug that filled incorrectly the message's dialog.

	Added flags to prevent crash with void strings

1999-02-07  Matthias Köster <Matthias.Koester@Informatik.Uni-Oldenburg.DE>
	* app/display.[ch]:
	Added statusbar to the display widget. Currently shows the zoom
	factor and modified flag of the viewed diagram. The statusbar is
	updated upon calls to ddisplay_zoom and ddisplay_update_statusbar.
	This caused the following additions:
	
	* app/diagram.[ch]:
	Added function diagram_set_modified. Calls
	ddisplay_update_statusbar for all displays showing the modified diagram.
	Changed diagram_modified to call diagram_set_modified.
	
	* app/interface.c:
	Added the creation of the statusbar.
	
	* app/load_save.c:
	diagram_save now calls diagram_set_modified instead of setting
	dia->modified. Needed to force call to display_update_statusbar
	
	* app/commands.c:
	Changed the way view_show_all works. Now calls ddisplay_zoom
	instead of directly setting the zoom_factor, so the zoom factor is
	correctly shown in the statusbar.

	* app/magnify.c:
	Fixed rubberband zoom to use ddisplay_zoom().

	this method is called. (Not all objects do this yet,
	to be fixed.)

	* TODO:
	Some small updates

1998-11-01  Alexander Larsson  <alla@lysator.liu.se>

	* lib/font.c
	Fixed problem with height of ascent and descent for fonts.

	This change breaks fileformat compatibility for these objects.
	
	* objects/standard/zigzagline.c:
	Changed zigzagline to be based on OrthConn, much nicer.
	Also added line style and color to properties.
	This change breaks fileformat compatibility for zigzagline.

	connected HANDLE_MINOR_CONTROL also becomes red.

	* objects/network/network.c:
	* objects/UML/uml.c:
	* most objects:
	Changed the way sheets reference objects to use just the
	name. Changed module loading to a two stage model:
	First register_objects() is called for all modules.

	Always select the last handle in an object that has
	the closest distance.
