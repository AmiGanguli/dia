	* Makefile.am:
	removed -ldl from linking. This is added if needed by configure.

	* app/app_procs.c:
	Open dlls with RTLD_LAZY if it is defined.
	Some cleanups: char *error -> const char *error
	Added fprintf()'s to where we exited because of errors.

	* lib/files.c:
	Include <sys/types.h>

	* acconfig.h:
	* configure.in:
	* app/app_procs.c:
	Detect dlopen better.
	Detect wether dlopen needs an underscore in the identifier.
	This code was mostly borrowed from guile.

	* lib/sheet.[ch]:
	* app/app_procs.c:
	* objects/standard/standard.c:
	* objects/network/network.c:
	* objects/UML/uml.c:
	* most objects:
	Changed the way sheets reference objects to use just the
	name. Changed module loading to a two stage model:
	First register_objects() is called for all modules.
	Then register_sheets() is called. This means that
	sheets can safely include objects from other modules.

	* objects/network/network.c:
	* objects/network/Makefile.am:

	* app/connectionpoint_ops.c:
	* app/create_object.c:
	* app/group.c:
	* app/handle_ops.c:
	* app/modify_tool.c:
	* lib/connection.c:
	* lib/element.c:
	* lib/handle.h:
	* lib/object.c:
	* lib/orth_conn.c:
	* loads of objects:
	Changed handle->connectable to handle->connect_type.
	Now handles can be HANDLE_CONNECTABLE_NOBREAK, which means
	that their connections don't break when moving objects.

	* app/diagram.c:
	Always select the last handle in an object that has
	the closest distance.
	
	* lib/geometry.[ch]:
	Added rectangle_add_point function.

	* app/properties.[ch]: New files. Handles the new properties
	dialog.

	* app/modify_tool.c: Changed to use new properties dialog.

	* app/object_ops.[ch]: Removed object_changed_callback, as it's
	not needed anymore. This is now handled differently in
	properties.c

	* lib/object.[ch]:
	Changed the properties ops for objects. Removed typedefs
	ChangedObjectTime and ObjectChangedFunc needed for the old way.
	Added object_return_null function.
	
	* app/group.c:
	* lib/render_object.c:
	* objects/*/*.c:
	Changed objects to use the new properties dialog.

	* */Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Changes to work with srcdir !=
	builddir.

	* autogen.sh: New file. Copied from gtk and added a call to
	libtoolize. Anyone knows why this isn't done in gtk?

	* Removed autogenerated files.

1998-09-12  Alexander Larsson  <alla@lysator.liu.se>

	* Added call setlocale(LC_NUMERIC, "C") so that formating of

	* Did some cleanup of generated postscript files.
