dia-0.93.1: 25-May-2004

Brown bag release due to shapes properties bug.  Also fixes problems
with options when no popt is present, and distribution of docs.

dia-0.93: 29-Apr-2004

Ready for release.

dia-0.93-pre2: 04-Apr-2004

Fixed crash bug in ellipse, plus various compilation problems.  Also
renamed the dia manual to make dia.spec work better and did a few updates
to dia.spec.

dia-0.93-pre1: 11-Mar-2004

Major improvements in this release include:

* Text-rendering is faster due to a Pango layout cache.

* The Win32 version now also uses Freetype2 rendering, allowing more
  unified appearance and antialiasing.

* Standard Ellipse now has connection point and handle in center, and
  is resized around the center.

* Arrow head size selection now keeps aspect ratio by default.

* Line style and arrow head selectors now visual instead of textual in
  properties dialogs.

* Several sets of shapes added, including isometric map, cybernetics, 

* Added navigation window in lower-right corner.

* UML objects can now have color.

* Dia can now convert objects without requiring X.  PNG size can be
  specified with --size.

* Menus have been overhauled, more shortcuts added.

* Preedit text input much improved.

* Numerous improvements in metapost and xfig filters.

* Default arrow size now 0.5 cm.

* Minimum diagram size is very small now.

* Improvements to the Python plug-in.

* Shapes now support images.

* Greeked text replacing very small font rendering.

* Added XSLT sheets:  Python, OWL, Mac, Component List

  retained.  Also fixed crash bug that tried to resize unresizable objects
  and connections update for children.

dia-0.92.1: 26-Oct-2003

* Brown Bag release.  Fixes crashbug in the "Analog Clock" symbol, and bug
  with pasting multiple lines of text.

dia-0.92: 19-Oct-2003

* Like pre7, but with some updated translations and documentation.  Now
  included man page.

dia-0.92-pre7: 14-Oct-2003

* EPS output with built-in fonts now does locale conversion.  The PS still
  thinks it's Latin-1.

dia-0.92-pre6: 11-Oct-2003

* Cisco sheets install fix.

dia-0.92-pre5: 11-Oct-2003

* Icon fix.

dia-0.92-pre3: 22-Sep-2003

* Working caching of Pango context removes huge slowdown from pre2.

dia-0.92-pre2: 11-Sep-2003

* Ensure loading of fonts and (semi-)correct DPI setting for Pango.
* Use $PRINTER correctly in print dialog.
* Read comments in XFig files.
* Change to CHM manual format for Windows.
* Some minor bug fixes.

dia-0.92-pre1: 2-Sep-2003

Object developers please note:
This update contains a binary compatibility change.  Your objects will need
to be recompiled and some prototypes changed (*_move_handle in particular).

* Autorouting of orthconn lines.  Still fairly primitive, doesn't avoid
  objects, but at least goes the right way out of connectionpoints (when
  connectionpoints have their dirs set).
* Parenting.  Objects can now be set to be parents of others (so far, only
  the UML Large Package is set so by default).  Objects created into these
  or explicitly added are moved with the parent and cannot be moved
  outside.
* Dynamic grid that changes with zoom scale.
* Grid now has thicker line every n lines (default 5).  Stippled grid
  option removed.
* ESC and Enter now usable for exiting properties dialogs.
* Mouse wheel(s) can be used to scroll and zoom. 
* When using menu bar, middle button pans the diagram.
* Documents now remember if they were compressed or not when loaded.
* Documents are always prettyprinted, to allow CVS.
* More diagram properties can be set for existing diagrams, and are loaded
  and saved.
* UML Component features:  Event sources and sinks.
* Improved undo of grouping and ungrouping.
* Updates of the Python plugin:
  - groups, rgb, and images can be manipulated
  - better svg parsing
* XFig arrow head import and export, and correct dash lengths
* Now remembers the last selected sheet.
* Better Metapost output, with images.
* Gnome and Gnome HIG conformance better.
* Better text alignment in flowchart objects.
* Window positions are now remembered from run to run.
* Standardization of error messages and shape descriptions.
* Better SVG export.
* Better arrow head calculations.
* More tooltips.
* Snap to grid icon in status bar.
* Opens a new diagram if Dia is started with a non-existing file as argument.
* A number of various bugs fixed.

Things that actually might need doing first:  Win32 color thing,
ESC/Return capture in props dialogs

dia-0.91: 14-Mar-2003
Identical to dia-0.91-pre6 except for translation updates.

dia-0.91-pre6: 4-Mar-2003
* Configure fix
* Install of png fix.

  - Diagram window not set as toolbar anymore.
  - Command-line parsing for Gnome.
  - A number of Windows-specific fixes.
  - Several minor bugs.

* Pixbuf export added on Unix side, plus several fixes in here.
* Better check for finite in configure.in.
* Updates of dependencies and RPM spec file.

dia-0.91-pre1: 31-Jan-2003

* Dia now uses Gtk2 which makes it look much prettier (menu
  icons, scrolling menus, less flicker, better international 
  text support, ...)
* Dia tries to follow the Gnome User Interface Guidelines which
  should make it more consistent with the Gnome2 desktop
* Requires libgtk2.x instead of libgtk1.2. FIXME:
  document exactly what we need (do it in INSTALL too)
* Relies on FreeType (pangoft2) for all Unix-side text handling.
* Since text handling is totally changed, old diagrams will have different
  text sizes.  
* Most Dia objects now support setting some defaults. Simply 
  double-click on the respective object button to change them.
* Better feedback what will happen by changing cursors e.g. for 
  moving or connecting objects
* Revamped DiaRenderers : Beside more maintainable source code
  this gives export fiters the ability to write e.g. bezier
  approximations without having to write a single line of code
  in the export filter.
* Improved lines with arrows handling
* Autosave support.  No automatic restore yet.
* The new XSLT plugin uses the gnome libxslt to export documents from 
  DIA. The library is not required at compile time.
* There is a new plug-in called 'Pixbuf' to export to jpeg and 
  png (without the need of libart)
* The Python plug-in allows to write more powerful scripts now,
  see diasvg.py for an example. More examples! The only documentation
  beside examples and C source is on the Dia Twiki
  (http://faemalia.org/wiki/view/Technical/DiaEditor)
* UML classes can carry comments
* A bunch of new Shapes
* Support for dynamic refresh (animated objects)


dia-0.90:  1-June-2002

* identical to 0.90.RC3 save for some makefile juggling.

dia-0.90.RC3:  30-May-2002

* in FreeType mode, dia now looks for the xfs configuration files too
  to retrieve the font path.
* Polish version of the manual added
* a load-time compatibility issue with files produced by 0.88.1 was
  found and fixed for some UML objects.
* we now better use the intltool facilities
* various build problems on Solaris fixed and/or documented.

dia-0.90.RC2:  24-May-2002

* increased tolerance to broken XML files
* ER objects can have their text size changed
* a couple bugs (i18n, l10n, p9y) fixed

dia-0.90.RC1:  13-May-2002

* from now on, all XML files produced by dia will be encoded as UTF-8.
  This version of dia is also capable of reading dia file encoded with
  any other encoding the libxml2 parser embedded in libxml1 is able to
  understand. One exception: the encoding declaration >must< be present.

* all previously generated XML files (.pluginrc and .dia files,
  mostly) will now cause a warning about a missing encoding, and the
  default dia will take. If you have properly compiled dia, it should
  choose the charset you normally use. This is normal and there is no
  other sane possible way.

* Metapost renderer
* Unicode builds are now mandatory. The software internally always talks UTF-8.
* Updated Python interface.
* Faster Postscript files.
* More options in the UML Class dialog.
* An optional menu bar can be added to each display window, in
  addition to the popup menu.
* All RenderObjects have been replaced by equivalent shapes, and
  RenderObject support code removed.
* All Lazyprop objects have been converted to Standard Properties
  instead. Lazyprop support code removed.
* lots of internal changes and cleanups in the StdProp code. This
  breaks binary compatibility.
* ongoing UTF-8 audit.
* libxml-1.8.14 is now needed; you can also have libxml2 installed,
  but don't build with both development packages installed (this will 
  most certanly end up in a library mismatch. To avoid this, the
  configure script will stop if it detects both libxml development
  packages)
* Shapes can now have a <svg:text> element.
* polybeziers and beziergons now have their bounding box properly computed.
* autoconf-2.50 is strongly recommended (2.13 should still be fine) if
  you want to call ./autogen.sh.
* You now need libtool-1.4 to build the package.
* automake-1.4-p4 is probably needed as well.
* gettext-0.10.38 is now mandatory if you want to call ./autogen.sh.
* intltools-0.12 is now mandatory if you want to call ./autogen.sh. 

  In general, don't call ./autogen.sh at all if your system is not on
  the bleeding edge.

* You need recent versions of the packages {jade, docbook,
  docbook-utils, docbook-dsssl, docbook-stylesheets,
  docbook-style-dsssl, gnome-doc-tools-2-0, cygnus-stylesheets, etc.}
  of the whole DocBook rendering system, to build the documentation.
  The exact names of the packages vary from system to system; this
  list is only a starting point! If compiling the documentation fails,
  please report on dia-list@gnome.org once you've found which packages 
  to install. However, you can disable the compilation of
  documentation if it's too much trouble to fix.
* a few new shapes have been added.
* crashes in the right-click menu have been nailed.

 
dia-0.88:  11-May-2001
* Input method support should work correctly now.
* SVG shape files now use namespace from final W3C recommendation.
  Addon shapes will have to be modified to use the
  http://www.w3.org/2000/SVG namespace for SVG.  SVG export filter
  also uses correct doctype.
* menus should now work in both gtk+ and gnome builds and have no i18n
  related problems.  Don't look in app/menus.c.
* pstricks renderer output should now work fine without modification now.
* gdk-pixbuf is now a requirement for building dia.  It no longer
  falls back to imlib if it can't find gdk-pixbuf.
* handle "file not found" errors better in the image object type.
* Dia now has documentation thanks to the GDP.  The help menu now has
  more than just an about menu item.
* Antialiased drawing mode probably won't crash dia anymore
* Dia has a splash screen now (which can be turned off with the
  --nosplash option).
* Updated bonobo support (when --enable-bonobo is used)
* added expose event compression for the dia canvas, which makes dia
  more usable over remote X connections.
* Many objects updated to use properties interface.
* experimental unicode print support (--enable-unicode)
* updates to the python plugin and now distribute it with dia (--with-python)
* many new shapes and export filter plugins.
* other bug fixes.

dia-0.86:  6-August-2000
* Dia is now an official GNU program.
* Bug fixes to polygon, so that undo/redo of adding a point works correctly,
  and added extra connection points to shape. (james)
* added unfinished DXF import filter (Steffen).
* XIM support added.
* added beziergon object. (james)
* The right click menu now behaves correctly when torn off.  Actions will be
  performed on the last active display, which is defined as the last display
  to receive mouse clicks or keyboard input. (james)
* added little button to top left hand corner of display for bringing up
  the right click menu, as in gimp-1.1. (james)
* Layers dialog changes selected diagram when the active display changes.
  (james)
* fixed bug in custom shape code affecting drawing of ellipses/circles.
* WPG and HPGL export filters added (Hans)
* Updated gnome-print code so that it respects the settings in the page
  setup dialog.  The gnome-print code is still not as good as the straight
  postscript code.
* Added a diagram properties dialog where you can manipulate the grid
  settings (which are now saved with the diagram) and background colour.
* many other bug fixes.

dia-0.85:  18-May-2000
* Bug fix for bringing up properties window when a group of objects that don't
  implement the properties code are selected (james).
* New sheets: Pneumatic, Electric and Civil (from Cyrille and Steffen).
* New export filters: TeX PSTricks and DXF (from Jacek and Steffen
  respectively).
* New polygon object (Lars).
* You can now select between symmetric, smooth and cusp as the vertex style
  for the segments in a bezier line object (Lars, james).
* Some fixups to make sure preferences and save files are written with
  LC_NUMERIC set to C (james).
* dia will now use gdk-pixbuf in preference to imlib if it is found on the
  system when compiling.
* there is a simple (unfinished) bonobo component now.  To build it, you
  must pass --enable-bonobo to configure (this will not affect whether the
  normal dia is built).  (Alex)
* Bug fixes in FS objects by David Thompson.
* new plugin system, along with a plugin manager where you can prevent
  plugins from being loaded (james).
* Objects handled by the custom sheet code now have a better distance
  algorithm -- before it just used a bounding box (james).
* New select submenu in the right click menu that makes it easier to select
  groups of objects (Lars).

dia-0.84:  29-February-2000
* Bug fixes in sheet loading and object initialisation code -- this fixes
  some of the seg faults in 0.83.
* Lots of new shapes (GRAFCET, SADT, chronogram and Contact from Cyrille)
* Fixed up fit to page so that it adjusts the scaling as you change the
  size of the diagram.  Also allow fit to multiple pages.
* Show page breaks on diagram (this can be disabled in the preferences).
* CGM export filter fixes (most of this work was by Henk Jan Priester).
* SVG export filter fixes -- now it handles images as well.
* EPS filter now uses scaling factor set in page setup dialog.  This was
  added because some apps do not allow scaling of an EPS file after importing
  it.
* High quality anti aliased libart based renderer (Alex).
* PNG export filter (requires libpng and libart).
* toolbox is resizable kind of like the gimp-1.1 toolbox.
* Win32 port by Hans Breuer -- see http://hans.breuer.org/dia/
* Start of support for properties code.  THIS IS NOT FINISHED AND THE
  INTERFACES ARE LIKELY TO CHANGE IN THE NEXT RELEASE.  DON'T WRITE NEW
  OBJECTS AGAINST THESE NEW INTERFACES UNLESS YOU ARE PREPARED FOR THEM TO
  BREAK WITH THE NEXT RELEASE.  That said, this adds a number of nice
  features for users.  You can now group a number of properties supporting
  objects (currently the `standard' objects, custom objects and the
  flowchart box), and change some of the properties as a group.

dia-0.83:
* Copying/pasting of bezier and image objects should work correctly.
* New export filter interface, which allows export filters to be
  loaded from plugins rather than being integrated into the application.
* New CGM export plugin.  It currently doesn't handle beziers yet, but
  it does handle all other aspects of rendering.
* Fixed rendering of logo in about dialog.
* Don't reencode the symbol font in latin1, as this stops it working.
* Renamed the --export-to-ps option to --export (the short form is still -e).
  It now works out which filter to use based on the file extension.
* Portability fixes.

dia-0.82:
* Dia has a new maintainer now.
* It is now possible to rearange the icons in the toolbox by editing
  simple XML files.  You can also create new sheets composed of your
  favourite shapes.  This feature is the work of Cyrille Chepelov
* New bezierline object.  This object is by Lars Clausen and me (James).
* Better integration with the gnome file manager -- dia files now have an
  icon, and you can double click on a file to launch dia.
* more memory leak fixes based on purify runs by Bruce Mitchener.
* By holding down shift when using the zoom tool, you can zoom out.  This
  feature was from Patrick Reynolds.
* By holding shift when using the move tool, it changes its behaviour to the
  `grab' type scrolling as seen in acrobat, eog and other programs.
* More circuit shapes from Andreas Scherf.
* Other bug fixes I haven't mentioned above (see ChangeLog for details).

News in version 0.81:
* New printing dialog with "Fit to page" and landscape printing
* New Circuit objects
* Fixed loading saving of flowcharts and custom object. This would
  make dia crash when loading saved files.
