As well as updating the .po files for translations, you should also
update the .sheet files in the sheets directory.  These are simple XML
files that hold the descriptions of the objects in the sheets in the
toolbox.

You need to add extra <description> elements with the appropriate
xml:lang attribute for your language to the file.  Once those are
added, the names of objects in the toolbox should be translated.

Also, you can have a look at the file "sheet-translation-report" in
the sheets directory.
