REQUIREMENTS:
=============

Dia needs Gtk+ at least version 1.2.0 installed.
It can be found at:

ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/gtk/v1.2/

Binaries available at:
  ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/gtk/binary/devel/RPMS/
or
  ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/gtk/binary/devel/DEBIAN/

As of version 0.30 Dia also needs libxml (aka gnome-xml). I recommend you
get a fairly recent version, but not version 1.8.0.  It can be found here:
  ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/stable/sources/gnome-xml/

As of version 0.40 Dia needs gdk_imlib, at least version 1.8.2.
It can be found here:
  ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/stable/sources/imlib/

As of version 0.86, Dia requires either gdk_imlib (version 1.8.2 or newer)
or gdk-pixbuf (version 0.7.0 or newer).  Older versions of Dia used
gdk_imlib only.  Gdk_imlib will probably be phased out after a while.
Gdk-pixbuf can be found here:
  ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/unstable/sources/gdk-pixbuf/
Gdk_imlib can be found here:
  ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/stable/sources/imlib/

BUILDING:
=========

To build, run:

 ./configure
 make

PLATFORM NOTES:
===============

AFS
	The fact that you on AFS can make hard links within, but not
	between directories might cause problems due to a bug in
	libtool (at least som versions). 
	What happens is that messages like
		Waiting for arc.o.lock to be removed
	repeats themselves during compliation.

	A couple of work arounds are
	available: Run configure with the flag
	--disable-libtool-lock. This might break parallel builds
	though. Another (uglier) fix is to hack the libtool script
	generated by configure. Change the line:

          until ln "$0" "$lockfile" 2>/dev/null; do

	to

          until ln "$srcfile" "$lockfile" 2>/dev/null; do


COMPILING FROM CVS:
===================

If you are using the cvs version of Dia you need to have the following programs:
automake 1.4, autoconf 2.13, libtool 1.3, GNU gettext 0.10.38

Then run ./autogen.sh instead of configure to create all needed files.

WARNING: if you run ./autogen.sh, you will need to have gettext
0.10.38 installed, or to extract a few M4 files from that package and
include them manually into aclocal.m4.

TRYING IT OUT:
==============

You can try out dia in the compilation directory by running
 ./app/run_dia.sh

INSTALL:
========
install it by doing:

 make install

By default Dia is installed in /usr/local.
You can change that by passing --prefix=/some/dir to configure.


FONTS:
======
I recommend that you install the URW fonts if you haven't already.
They are free scalable version of the standard postscript fonts.
